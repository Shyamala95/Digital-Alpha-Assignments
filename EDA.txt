Given a sample data, what are the ways to summarize them for exploratory data analysis.      
 
Exploratory Data Analysis means analyzing the datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often visually.
This is the first step of any data analysis.    
                                              
Exploratory Data Analysis is valuable to data science projects since it allows to get closer to the certainty that the future results will be valid, correctly interpreted, and applicable to the desired business contexts. Such level of certainty can be achieved only after raw data is validated and checked for anomalies, ensuring that the data set was collected without errors. EDA also helps to find insights that were not evident or worth investigating to business stakeholders and data scientists but can be very informative about a particular business.

EDA is performed in order to define and refine the selection of feature variables that will be used for machine learning. Once data scientists become familiar with the data set, they often have to return to feature engineering step, since the initial features may turn out not to be serving their intended purpose. Once the EDA stage is complete, data scientists get a firm feature set they need for supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

Exploratory Data Analysis performed using the following steps:

Univariate visualization :
        It  provides summary statistics for each field in the raw data set
Bivariate visualization:
       It  is performed to find the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable of interest
Multivariate visualization:
       It  is performed to understand interactions between different fields in the dataset
Dimensionality reduction:
       It  helps to understand the fields in the data that account for the most variance between observations and allow for the processing of a reduced volume of data.
